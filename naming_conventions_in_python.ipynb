    "In Python, naming conventions are essential for writing clean, readable, and maintainable code. Below is a comprehensive list of naming conventions, ranging from basic to professional levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Basic Naming Conventions**\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the fundamental rules that every Python developer should follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **a. Variables and Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **snake_case** for variable and function names.\n",
    "  - Example: `user_name`, `calculate_total()`\n",
    "- Names should be descriptive and concise.\n",
    "  - Example: `total_price` instead of `tp`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **b. Constants**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for constants.\n",
    "  - Example: `MAX_USERS`, `PI = 3.14159`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **c. Modules and Packages**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **snake_case** for module and package names.\n",
    "  - Example: `data_processing.py`, `utils/`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **d. Avoid Single-letter Names**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid single-letter names unless they are used in a very limited scope (e.g., loop counters).\n",
    "  - Example: Use `for index in range(10)` instead of `for i in range(10)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Intermediate Naming Conventions**\n",
    "\n",
    "These conventions are used for more structured and professional code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **a. Classes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **PascalCase** (also known as CamelCase) for class names.\n",
    "  - Example: `class UserProfile:`, `class DataProcessor:`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **b. Private Variables and Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a single leading underscore `_` to indicate private variables or methods (not enforced by Python, but a convention).\n",
    "  - Example: `_private_variable`, `__private_method()`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **c. Protected Variables and Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a single leading underscore `_` for protected members (intended for internal use within a class or subclass).\n",
    "  - Example: `_protected_variable`, `_protected_method()`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **d. Magic Methods (Dunder Methods)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use double underscores `__` for magic (dunder) methods.\n",
    "  - Example: `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Advanced/Professional Naming Conventions**\n",
    "\n",
    "These conventions are used in larger projects and professional environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **a. Global Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **snake_case** for global variables, but prefix them with `g_` or `global_` to indicate their scope.\n",
    "  - Example: `g_total_users`, `global_config`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **b. Class Attributes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **snake_case** for class attributes.\n",
    "  - Example: `class User: default_role = \"member\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **c. Enums**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **PascalCase** for enum class names and **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for enum members.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from enum import Enum\n",
    "    class UserRole(Enum):\n",
    "        ADMIN = \"admin\"\n",
    "        MEMBER = \"member\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **d. Type Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **PascalCase** for type variables in type hints.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from typing import TypeVar\n",
    "    T = TypeVar('T')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **e. Abbreviations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely accepted (e.g., `id` for identifier, `url` for Uniform Resource Locator).\n",
    "  - Example: Use `user_id` instead of `usr_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **f. Contextual Naming**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use names that reflect the context or domain of the problem.\n",
    "  - Example: In a banking app, use `account_balance` instead of `balance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Special Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "These are specific naming conventions for particular scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **a. Test Files and Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **snake_case** for test file names and prefix test functions with `test_`.\n",
    "  - Example: `test_calculations.py`, `def test_addition():`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **b. Configuration Files**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **snake_case** for configuration keys.\n",
    "  - Example: `max_connections`, `timeout_seconds`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **c. Database Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **snake_case** for table and column names in databases.\n",
    "  - Example: `user_profile`, `created_at`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **d. API Endpoints**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **snake_case** or **kebab-case** for API endpoints.\n",
    "  - Example: `/user-profile`, `/order-history`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. PEP 8 Guidelines**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's official style guide, **PEP 8**, provides the following recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **snake_case** for variables, functions, and methods.\n",
    "- Use **PascalCase** for class names.\n",
    "- Use **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for constants.\n",
    "- Avoid using names that conflict with Python keywords (e.g., `class`, `def`, `import`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Tools to Enforce Naming Conventions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linters**: Use tools like `flake8`, `pylint`, or `black` to enforce naming conventions.\n",
    "- **IDE/Editor Plugins**: Configure your IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm) to highlight naming convention violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these conventions, you can write Python code that is consistent, readable, and professional.\n"

    "In Python, naming conventions are important for writing clean, readable, and maintainable code. They help establish consistency and make it easier for others (and yourself) to understand and work with the code. Python follows conventions that are described in **PEP 8**, which is the official style guide for Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main types of naming conventions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Variable Names**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lowercase letters with words separated by underscores**: This is called `snake_case`.\n",
    "  - Example: `my_variable`, `total_amount`\n",
    "- Used for: Variables, function arguments, and method arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Function Names**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lowercase letters with words separated by underscores**: This is also `snake_case`.\n",
    "  - Example: `def my_function():`, `def calculate_total():`\n",
    "- Used for: Functions and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Class Names**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Capitalize each word, without underscores**: This is called `PascalCase` or `CamelCase` (but PascalCase is more common in Python).\n",
    "  - Example: `class MyClass:`, `class AnimalType:`\n",
    "- Used for: Class names.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Constants**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **All uppercase letters with words separated by underscores**: This is called `UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE`.\n",
    "  - Example: `MAX_VALUE`, `PI`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`\n",
    "- Used for: Constants (values that should not change).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Module Names**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lowercase letters with words separated by underscores**: `snake_case`.\n",
    "  - Example: `math_operations.py`, `data_analysis.py`\n",
    "- Used for: Module names.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Package Names**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **All lowercase letters without underscores**: This is often called `lowercase`.\n",
    "  - Example: `numpy`, `requests`, `mypackage`\n",
    "- Used for: Package names.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Private Variables and Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prefix with a single underscore `_`**: This is a convention indicating that a variable or method is intended for internal use (a hint for the programmer, not enforced by Python).\n",
    "  - Example: `_internal_variable`, `_helper_function()`\n",
    "- Used for: Private or internal variables and methods that should not be accessed directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Private Variables and Methods (Strong)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prefix with double underscores `__`**: This causes name mangling (the name is changed internally to avoid accidental overrides), but it’s not true encapsulation.\n",
    "  - Example: `__private_variable`, `__secret_method()`\n",
    "- Used for: More strongly private variables and methods. The name is internally changed (mangled) to make accidental access harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Special Methods (Dunder Methods)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Double underscores at both ends of the name**: These are used for special methods, also known as \"magic methods\" or \"dunder methods.\"\n",
    "  - Example: `__init__()`, `__str__()`, `__len__()`\n",
    "- Used for: Built-in Python methods like constructors, string representations, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Type Variables (Generic Programming)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uppercase letters with single letters (typically)**: This is used for type variables in generic programming.\n",
    "  - Example: `T`, `U`, `K`\n",
    "- Used for: Type hinting in generic code (e.g., in `typing`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **Global Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uppercase with words separated by underscores**: While this is not strictly required, it’s often used to distinguish global variables from local ones.\n",
    "  - Example: `GLOBAL_VAR`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. **Type Hinting (PEP 484)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Describes the expected type of function arguments or return values**.\n",
    "  - Example: `def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:`\n",
    "- This is used to make the code more readable and explicit.\n",
